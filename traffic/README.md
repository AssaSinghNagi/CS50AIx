# My Experiments With This ML Project
Before starting this project i read some parts of Tensorflow's documentation and found out about Tensorflow's video lectures I completed 3 lecture in about an hour and was now ready to start working. I first started with with a simple neural network consisting of: **Conv2D(64, (3,3)), MaxPool(2,2), Flatten(), Dense(128), Dense(NUM_CATEGORIES)**. I got **0.91 to 0.93 accuracy on test data**. Then I remembered that we had to add some DropOut to avoid overfitting so i added a **Dropout(0.3)**. I was now getting **0.05 to 0.37 accuracy on test data**. Then I ***changed Dropout(0.3) to Dropout(0.1)***. I got **0.90 to 0.94 accuracy**. So I **added another Conv2D(64, (3,3)) and MaxPooling(3,3)**. Now I was getting **0.93 to 0.96 accuracy**. I ***changed Dense(128) to Dense(256)***. Now the accuracy was **0.95 to 0.96**. I ***changed 1st Conv2D(64, (3,3)) to Conv2D(32, (3,3)) and Dropout to Dropout(0.23) and Dense to Dense(128)***. The acuuracy was **0.96 to 0.975**

I did some more changes by changing values in all layers but was not able to get better than.
